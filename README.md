# bfssh-9000
Brute Force SSH Login Tool

This tool has been developed in part using material from TCM's Python for Hackers course.

To run this tool, ensure that a .txt file is present in the current directory with the name "ssh-common-passwords.txt". 
This can be substituted for another file or parameter name of your choice.
